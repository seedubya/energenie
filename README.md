* lightcontrol.py - basic controller for pimoroni / energenie sockets. LINUX specific, but a bit more user friendly than the example code.
                  - also register sockets.

need to add the logic for determining the sunrise/set in python and then we have one script.
Parameters:
* WHEN - NOW|SUNRISE|SUNSET
* WHAT - ON | OFF
* WHO  - ALL | 1 | 1,2,3

also REG option.
